# MT4599-Codes-
Codes used during the writing of my MT4599 project. 

I am currently in the process of writing my final year year project for my undergraduate degree at the University of St Andrews. The project is an overview of the electric guitar from an applied maths perspective, where I study the motion of the plucked stringm the resulting requencies, the infulence of the magnetic fields on the sounds produced and the underlying mathematics of these processes. This respository complies all codes used during the writing of the project. All are original unless explicity stated.
